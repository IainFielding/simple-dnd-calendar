All notable changes to Simple D&D Calendar.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-10-23

### New

- **Additional calendars**, for settings D&D 5e doesn't cover. The GM ticks them under **Additional Calendars**, and
  they join D&D 5e's **Configure Calendar**: the **Exandrian Calendar** of Tal'Dorei and Wildemount, with its 21
  holidays and the moons Catha and Ruidus; and Dragonlance's **Solamnic Calendar**, with Solinari, Lunitari and
  Nuitari full together on the Night of the Eye every year and a half.
- **A trim for every adventure and setting.** **Dress the Bar for Your Adventure** now has a trim for every D&D
  adventure and campaign setting Wizards of the Coast has published for fifth edition, 48 in all, listed by name:
  from Lost Mine of Phandelver, Storm King's Thunder and Waterdeep: Dragon Heist to Candlekeep Mysteries, Keys from
  the Golden Vault and Dragon Delves; and for the Forgotten Realms, Eberron, Exandria, Ravnica, Theros, Strixhaven,
  Spelljammer, Dragonlance, Planescape, Greyhawk, Lorwyn-Shadowmoor and Netheril. A setting and its adventures share
  a trim. Curse of Strahd's now covers Ravenloft too.
- **Every Exandrian holiday dresses the sky.** Fourteen new trims for the sky, from New Dawn's sunrise and the
  Day of Challenging's storm to Barren Eve's candles and Embertide's embers; the other seven holidays share the
  festivals' trims, as the Renewal Festival shares Greengrass's.
- **Trims and Styles**, a page in the docs with a picture of every trim for the bar and the sky, and each style.

### Changed

- **Eberron's moons follow their months.** As *Rising from the Last War* names each month for the moon closest to
  the world then, each of the twelve moons is full in the middle of its own month in 998 YK.
- The module's artwork on Foundry's setup screen shows the calendar as it comes, on a spring evening.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-10-23

### New

- **The Tears of Selûne** glitter after her across the bowl, fading as the sky grows light. Modules can give any
  moon the same trail with `trail: "tears"` in the `sogrom-simple-dnd-calendar.moons` hook.
- **Works with Tomb of Annihilation.** The GM's Adventure Tracker button, which the adventure adds to D&D 5e's
  calendar, sits on the bar with the other buttons.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-23

### New

- **Festivals dress the sky** for the day while it follows the seasons: holly and bells for Midwinter, grass and
  daisies for Greengrass, lanterns for Midsummer, bunting and shields for Shieldmeet, wheat and apples for
  Highharvestide, and moonflowers for the Feast of the Moon, and likewise for Greyhawk's festival weeks.
- **Dress the Bar for Your Adventure**, a trim for the bar, alongside the sky's: Curse of Strahd, The Wild Beyond
  the Witchlight, Descent into Avernus, Rime of the Frostmaiden, Arcana Unleashed, Arcana Unleashed: Deadfall, World
  of Warcraft, Vecna: Eve of Ruin, Tomb of Annihilation, and Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk.

### Changed

- **Dress the Frame for the Season** is now **Dress the Sky for the Season**, and dresses only the sky's rim, about
  the day wheel. It is a choice: None, Follow the Seasons, or Just Winter, Spring, Summer or Autumn to keep one
  season's trim all year. Worlds that had it on now follow the seasons.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-22

### New

- **Scenes darken at night.** Turn on **Darken Scenes at Night** and the active scene's darkness follows the sky:
  the light fades through the late afternoon and twilight by the height of the sun, and a bright moon lifts the dark
  of night a little. Scenes with their darkness locked are left alone.
- **Long summer days.** Turn on **Long Summer Days** and sunrise and sunset move with the seasons, from sixteen hours
  of daylight at midsummer to eight at midwinter. The day wheel, the scene's darkness, and D&D 5e's dawn and dusk
  recovery all follow.
- **Chat commands.** `/date` whispers you the date, the season, any festival and the moons' phases. The GM can move
  the time with `/advance` and `/rewind`, by an amount (`/advance 8 hours`, `/rewind 1d 6h`) or to the next or last
  dawn, noon, dusk or midnight (`/advance dawn`).
- **Each dawn in the chat.** Turn on **Announce Each Dawn** and each new day is posted as the sun rises, with its
  date, the start of a season and any festival.
- **Full and new moons are marked** beside the bowl on the day they fall, and so are moons full together, such as
  Luna and Celene on Needfest. `/date` and the dawn in the chat say so too.
- **When's the next full moon?** Hover the season band for each moon's phase and the date it is next full.
- **Calendar styles.** Each player can pick **Gilded Night** (the default), **Parchment** or **Underdark** under
  **Calendar Style**.

### Changed

- The bar is solid in every style, rather than letting the scene show through.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-22

### New

- **The frame dressed for the season**: frost and icicles in winter, a flowering vine in spring, sunflowers in
  summer, and fallen leaves in autumn. Off by default; the GM can turn it on with **Dress the Frame for the Season**.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-22

### New

- **A new look for D&D 5e's calendar.** A framed bar across the top of the screen with the day and the time, a band
  of the year's seasons beneath it showing the date, and a bowl of sky with a day wheel that turns through the day.
- **Moons** for each of D&D 5e's calendars, showing their phases as they cross the sky: Selûne; Luna and Celene; the
  twelve moons of Eberron; and Earth's Moon.
- **Festival days** marked beside the bowl.
- **Changes of time play out**, with the clock running and the wheel and moons moving, unless **Animate Time
  Changes** is turned off.
- **The sky can be hidden**, leaving just the bar, and each player's choice is remembered.
- **Uses the calendar the GM picked** in D&D 5e's calendar settings.
- The GM is offered to turn D&D 5e's calendar on, the first time they load a world with the module.
